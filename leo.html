      Leo is a two year-old Shetland Sheepdog.
      <br>
      He likes squirrels and cheese.
      <br>
      He has been called a minature Border Collie, Australian Shepard, and even a Corgi. 
      <br>
      But most people just ask if he is a Mini Lassie (the answer is no). 
      <br>
      Rough Collies and Shelties have many differences and are not directly related.
      <br>
      Shelties are actually decesdants of Scottish Collies and King Charles Spaniels.
      <br>
      The three broad colors for a Sheltie are sable, black, and blue merle. 
      <br>
      Leo is technically a mahogany sable because he has a mix of black, white, and sable.
